To whom it may concern,

Currently, I am a full time software engineer working in an AI company called Cardinal Operation based in Beijing. Two years ago, I just finished my master degree of Information system and came back to China thinking that I was qualified to work as a software engineer to build something useful for the society. 

I'm passionate about programming and building things that is useful for people around. Being able to tell computer to work the way that I want is the coollest thing that I've ever seen. Thanks to the power of computing, we are now able to implement algorithms of automation using the power of Machine Learning. I want to be part of the technology revolution but the more I explore, the shallower I realize I am. That's why I decided to pursue higher education and decided to apply to this SEQUOIA program so that I can have a deeper understanding of the field that I want to work on. By doing so, I can have better understanding on the topic that I'm going to pursue so that I'm qualified to build better product to reward the society. I noticed that SEQUOIA has provided the sponsorship for pursuing higher education and I really need time for preparation out of the fulltime job. So I decided why not give it a try.

As you might notice, I have not started application for school yet. But I have a general plan on how to execute it in my mind. Here is the plan:

1. language: prepare for TOFEL and GRE, finish before July. 
2. list of university: HKUST (CS PHD), Carnegie Mellon University(CS PHD)
3. major: CS in computer vision or NLP.
4. application deadline: before December 2019.
5. enroll date: next year 2020 spring.

That is my plan and motivation for applying this program. Hope to hear from you soon.
