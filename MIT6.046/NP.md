# Why
knowing the limitation give us a sense of what kind of problems could be solved by computer? Are we going in the right path of solving problems? 


# Some definition
P: a set of problems that are solvable in polynomial time which is n ^ O(1).
NP: problems not in the set of P
NP-Complete:
NP-Hard:

# What matters
1. problems in NP could be reduced to
